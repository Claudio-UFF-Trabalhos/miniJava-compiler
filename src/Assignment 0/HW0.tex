% Question 1
\item	\mint{java}|Object o = "abc";|
	\begin{enumerate} 

	\item \mint{java}|char c = o.charAt(2);|
	This is not a legal Java statement, as the method \texttt{charAt} is not defined for the \texttt{Object} class to which \texttt{o} belongs.

	\item \mint{java}|boolean b = o.equals("abc");|
	This is a legal statement as the \texttt{equals} method is defined for the \texttt{Object} class. It returns \texttt{true}, which gets assigned to \texttt{b}.

	\item \mint{java}|String s = o;|
	This is not a legal Java statement as a variable of type \texttt{String} cannot hold the reference to an instance of the \texttt{Object} class, since \texttt{String} is a subclass of \texttt{Object}. It would have to be explicitly typecast into a \texttt{String} object.

	\item \mint{java}|char d = ((String) o).charAt(3);|
	This is a legal Java statement, as the object is typecast explicitly into a \texttt{String} object before calling the \texttt{charAt} method on it. However, the index passed to the method is out of the range of the string, causing it to throw a run time exception.

	\end{enumerate}

% Question 2
\item The following code shows how to access each of the four occurences of \texttt{x}:\\
	\inputminted{java}{Test.java}

% Question 3
\item
	\inputminted{nasm}{gcd.asm}
